This game is inspired by the "Rick and Morty" series on adult swim. 

Basically, you are given a specified time, counting down to 0. Within that time frame,
you must accumulate 35 points by shooting the falling characters from the series, where each 
character destroyed is worth one point. Note that characters spawn at random locations, to crank up
the difficulty of the game

To move, simply use the arrow keys (forward-up,backward-down, left-left_arrow, right-right_arrow). 
To pause, press the spacebar, and press return to resume. 
To shoot, simply click on the screen. The game ends when all characters disappear from the screen or when time runs out.
You also get a power up for every 5 characters you destroy, and this lasts for about 9 seconds
